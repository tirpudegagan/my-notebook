#### **A: Follow these steps:** #notepad 

1. **Open Your File:**
    
    - Open the list of names in **Notepad++**.
    - Example content:
        
        ```
        AlexSmith
        BellaJones
        ChrisBrown
        ```
        
2. **Open the Replace Tool:**
    
    - Press **Ctrl + H** to open the **Find and Replace** window.
3. **Set Up Find and Replace:**
    
    - In the **Find what** field, enter:
        
        ```
        ^(.+)
        ```
        
        (This matches each line in your file.)
    - In the **Replace with** field, enter:
        
        ```
        '$1',
        ```
        
        (This adds single quotes and a comma around each name.)
    - Check **Match using Regular Expression** (located at the bottom of the Replace window).
4. **Apply the Replacement:**
    
    - Click **Replace All** to apply the changes to the entire document.
5. **Result:**
    
    - Your content will now look like this:
        
        ```
        'AlexSmith',
        'BellaJones',
        'ChrisBrown',
        ```

### **Q: What does the Regular Expression `^(.+)` mean?**

#### **A: Explanation of Regular Expression:**

- `^` — Matches the start of a line.
- `(.+)` — Matches one or more characters on the line and groups them (captured as `$1` in the Replace field).

### **Q: How do I add single quotes and a comma manually in Notepad++ without Regex?**

#### **A: If you don’t want to use regular expressions:**

1. Use **Alt + Shift** to select a vertical block (column selection mode).
2. Place your cursor at the beginning of all lines, then type `'` (single quote).
3. Use the same method to add `',` (single quote + comma) at the end of each line.

### **Q: Can I do the same formatting in Excel?**
