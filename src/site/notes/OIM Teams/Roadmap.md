### **Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) Learning Roadmap: From Computing Basics to OIM Development**

This guide is structured to help individuals with no prior knowledge of Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) gradually build their expertise. The learning path is divided into four major phases, starting with basic computing concepts, advancing to Java programming, followed by OIM fundamentals, and finally diving into OIM development.

## **Phase 0: Why we need computers**

Before learning Programming language, it’s essential to have a good understanding of basic computing concepts. These are foundational knowledge that will help you understand how systems like OIM work at a technical level.

### **1.1 Basic Computer Concepts**

1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:

    - The "brain" of the computer. It processes instructions and performs tasks.
    - Types of CPUs: Single-core, multi-core.
    - Clock Speed: Measured in GHz, indicates how fast the CPU can process instructions.

2. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:

    - Temporary memory used by the computer to store data that is being actively used.
    - Important for running applications and multitasking. More RAM allows more programs to run simultaneously.

3. **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:

    - Permanent memory used to store firmware, or essential code that does not change, like the BIOS of a computer.

4. **Storage Devices**:

    - **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**: Mechanical storage device with larger capacity but slower speed.
    - **Solid-State Drive (SSD)**: Faster than HDD with no moving parts, used for rapid data retrieval.

5. **File Types**:

    - **.exe**: Executable files for launching programs.
    - **.txt**: Plain text files.
    - **.csv**: Comma-separated values, used for structured data like spreadsheets.
    - **.jar**: Java Archive files, used for Java programs.
    - **.xml/.json**: Data representation files, commonly used in APIs and configuration.

6. **Networking Basics**:
    - **IP Address**: Unique identifier for devices on a network.
    - **Protocols**: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, etc.
    - **Firewall**: A network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic.

## **[[OIM Teams/OIM Fundamentals\|Phase 3: OIM Fundamentals]]**

Once you have a good grasp of Java, you can move on to learning Oracle Identity Manager basics.

### **3.1 What is Oracle Identity Manager (OIM)?**

-   OIM is a comprehensive identity management solution from Oracle that automates the provisioning and de-provisioning of user accounts across systems and applications.

### **3.2 Core Concepts in OIM**

1. **Provisioning and De-provisioning**:

    - **Provisioning**: Assigning user access and accounts to resources like databases or applications.
    - **De-provisioning**: Removing access when it's no longer needed.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

    - **Roles**: Groups that define access privileges for users.
    - **Entitlements**: Specific permissions assigned to a role.

3. **User Lifecycle Management**:

    - Managing user accounts from creation, modification, and deactivation.

4. **Connectors**:

    - OIM uses connectors to communicate with external systems (e.g., Active Directory, databases).
    - **Pre-built connectors**: OIM comes with ready connectors for common systems like LDAP, Salesforce, etc.
    - **Custom connectors**: Developers can create connectors for non-standard systems.

5. **Reconciliation**:
    - Synchronizing data between OIM and external systems.
    - **Trusted Reconciliation**: Data flows from the trusted system (e.g., HR system) to OIM.
    - **Target Reconciliation**: Data flows from OIM to the target system.

### **3.3 OIM Architecture**

1. **OIM Server**: The central server that manages identity management tasks.
2. **Database**: Stores user data, configurations, and audit logs.
3. **WebLogic Server**: Application server used to run OIM.
4. **OIM Design Console**: A client application used by developers to configure and manage OIM workflows, rules, and forms.

## **[[OIM Teams/OIM Development\|Phase 4: OIM Development]]**

With Java knowledge and a good understanding of OIM concepts, you can now move on to OIM development. This phase focuses on customization, extending OIM functionalities, and developing custom connectors.

### **4.1 OIM Customization**

1. **OIM API (Java API)**:

    - **User Management**: Creating, updating, and managing user data through API.
    - **Provisioning Management**: Automating provisioning and de-provisioning tasks using API calls.
    - **Role Management**: Managing roles and entitlements using the API.

2. **Event Handlers**:

    - Java classes that listen to events (e.g., user creation, modification) and perform actions based on these events.
    - **Types of Event Handlers**: Pre-process, post-process, and conditional event handlers.
    - **Use cases**: Automatically adding entitlements when a user is created.

3. **Custom Adapters**:

    - Code that automates certain actions in OIM, such as pre-populating fields or assigning tasks.

4. **UI Customization**:
    - Customizing the OIM web interface using the Oracle Identity Self Service Console.
    - Adding custom fields, modifying forms, and changing approval workflows.

### **4.2 Developing Custom Connectors**

1. **Introduction to OIM Connectors**:

    - Custom connectors allow OIM to communicate with external systems that don’t have out-of-the-box support.

2. **Creating Custom Connectors**:
    - Develop Java-based connectors for integrating with non-standard systems.
    - Use the **Connector Framework** for building, testing, and deploying these connectors.

### **4.3 SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) Integrations**

-   Integrating OIM with Oracle SOA Suite for advanced business process automation.
-   **BPEL (Business Process Execution Language)** workflows for handling complex multi-step processes in identity management.

### **4.4 Debugging and Troubleshooting in OIM**

-   **Log Files**: Understanding the key log files for troubleshooting (WebLogic logs, OIM logs).
-   **Debugging Tools**: Using breakpoints, stack traces, and error logs to debug OIM code.

### **4.5 Deployment Best Practices**

1. **Testing in Sandbox**: Deploy and test customizations in a sandbox environment before moving to production.
2. **Moving to Production**: Steps for safely deploying custom connectors, adapters, and other customizations to the live system.
