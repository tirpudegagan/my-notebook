### 1. Understanding a Computer

#### Definition

A **computer** is an electronic device designed to process data. It can perform a wide range of tasks by executing instructions, which can include calculations, data processing, and control over other devices.

#### Components

Computers consist of two main components:

- **Hardware**:
    
    - **Physical parts** that you can touch and see. Here are some key hardware components:
        - **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It performs calculations and executes instructions from software. The CPU processes data by performing operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison.
        - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: This is temporary memory used by the CPU to store data and instructions that are currently in use. It is fast but volatile, meaning it loses all its information when the computer is turned off.
        - **Storage Devices**: These are used to permanently store data. Common types include:
            - **Hard Disk Drives (HDD)**: Traditional storage devices that use spinning disks to read/write data.
            - **Solid State Drives (SSD)**: Faster storage devices that use flash memory and have no moving parts.
- **Software**:
    
    - **Programs** that instruct the hardware on what tasks to perform. Software can be further divided into categories, such as:
        - **Operating Systems (OS)**: These manage the hardware and provide services for other software. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.
        - **Application Software**: Programs designed for specific tasks, like word processing (Microsoft Word), web browsing (Google Chrome), or gaming (Minecraft).

### 2. Fundamental Computer Concepts

#### Binary (0s and 1s)

Computers use the **binary number system**, which consists only of two digits: 0 and 1. This is the language of computers because it corresponds directly to the electrical signals inside the computer:

- **0** typically represents "off" (no current).
- **1** represents "on" (current flowing).

All data, whether it's text, images, or sounds, is ultimately represented in binary form within the computer.

#### Processor (CPU)

The **CPU** is the core component that executes instructions from software. It processes data using two main types of operations:

- **Arithmetic operations** (e.g., addition, subtraction).
- **Logic operations** (e.g., comparing two values).

The CPU operates at a high speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz), meaning it can perform billions of instructions per second.

#### Memory

- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
    
    - Temporary memory that stores data and programs that are currently in use. When you open a program, it gets loaded from the storage into RAM for quick access. However, when you turn off the computer, all data in RAM is lost.
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
    
    - A type of permanent memory that contains essential instructions for starting up the computer. Unlike RAM, the data in ROM is not lost when the computer is turned off. It often contains the firmware, which is software that is closely tied to specific hardware and usually does not need to change.

### 3. Storage Basics

#### Files

A **file** is a collection of data or information that is stored on a computer. Files can come in various formats, including:

- Documents (e.g., `.docx` for Word documents).
- Images (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png` for pictures).
- Videos (e.g., `.mp4`, `.avi` for movies).

Files are organized in directories (folders) on storage devices.

#### File Extensions

A **file extension** is a suffix at the end of a filename that indicates the type of file and tells the operating system which program should open it. For example:

- `.txt`: A plain text file.
- `.jpg`: A JPEG image file.
- `.exe`: An executable file that runs a program on Windows.

### 4. `.exe` Files

#### Definition

An **`.exe` file** (short for "executable file") is a specific type of file used on Windows operating systems. When you double-click an `.exe` file, it tells the computer to execute the instructions within that file.

#### Function

- When an `.exe` file is opened, it loads the necessary instructions into **RAM** and begins running as a **process** in the **CPU**. This means the CPU starts executing the commands contained in that file, such as displaying a user interface or performing calculations.

#### Security Note

- Be cautious with `.exe` files downloaded from unknown sources, as they can contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer. Always download software from trusted sources.

### 5. Software Types

#### System Software

- **System software** is designed to manage the computer's hardware and provide a platform for running application software. The most common example is the **Operating System (OS)**, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. The OS manages resources, handles input and output operations, and provides a user interface.

#### Application Software

- **Application software** is designed to help users perform specific tasks. Examples include:
    - Word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word).
    - Web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome).
    - Games (e.g., Fortnite).

These programs rely on system software to function and interact with the hardware.

### 6. Programs vs. Processes

#### Program

A **program** is a collection of instructions stored on a disk (e.g., in an `.exe` file). It is inactive until it is opened or executed. Think of it as a recipe that has not yet been cooked.

#### Process

A **process** is what happens when a program is actively running in memory. When you open a program, the operating system creates a process for it, which includes:

- Allocating RAM for the programâ€™s execution.
- Running the program's instructions in the CPU.
- Managing input/output operations for the program.

Once the program is closed, the process terminates, and the memory allocated to it is released.
