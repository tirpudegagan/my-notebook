### 1. Understanding a Computer

#### Definition

A **computer** is an electronic device designed to process data and perform tasks based on the instructions given to it.

#### Components

Computers consist of two main components:

-   **Hardware**:

    -   **Physical parts** that you can touch and see.
    -   **Examples**:
        -   **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It performs calculations and executes instructions from software.
            -   **Image Suggestion**: A diagram showing the CPU's location on a motherboard.
        -   **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary memory used by the CPU to store data and instructions that are currently in use.
            -   **Image Suggestion**: An image of RAM sticks, typically long and thin with chips.
        -   **Storage Devices**: Used to permanently store data.
            -   **Examples**:
                -   **Hard Disk Drives (HDD)**: Traditional storage devices that use spinning disks.
                    -   **Image Suggestion**: A photo showing the internal components of an HDD.
                -   **Solid State Drives (SSD)**: Faster storage devices that use flash memory.
                    -   **Image Suggestion**: A photo of an SSD, often a small rectangular box.

-   **Software**:
    -   **Programs** that instruct the hardware on what tasks to perform.
    -   **Examples**:
        -   **Operating Systems (OS)**: Windows, macOS, and Linux are popular examples.
            -   **Image Suggestion**: A screenshot of a Windows desktop interface.
        -   **Application Software**: Programs designed for specific tasks.
            -   **Examples**: Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, Adobe Photoshop.
            -   **Image Suggestion**: Icons of popular applications.

### 2. Fundamental Computer Concepts

#### Binary (0s and 1s)

Computers use the **binary number system**, which consists of two digits: 0 and 1.

-   **Example**:
    -   The letter "A" in ASCII is represented in binary as `01000001`.
-   **Image Suggestion**: A chart showing binary representations of letters or numbers.

#### Processor (CPU)

The **CPU** executes instructions from software by performing arithmetic and logic operations.

-   **Example**:
    -   If a program asks the CPU to add two numbers (e.g., 2 + 3), the CPU processes this request and returns the result (5).
-   **Image Suggestion**: An infographic showing how a CPU processes data.

#### Memory

-   **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
    -   Temporary memory that stores active data.
    -   **Example**: When you open a web browser, the data for all open tabs is stored in RAM until you close them or shut down the computer.
-   **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
    -   Permanent memory that contains essential startup instructions.
    -   **Example**: The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is stored in ROM, which helps boot the computer.
-   **Image Suggestion**: A diagram explaining the difference between RAM and ROM.

### 3. Storage Basics

#### Files

A **file** is a collection of data stored on a computer.

-   **Examples**:
    -   **Text Document**: `report.txt`
    -   **Image File**: `photo.jpg`
-   **Image Suggestion**: A screenshot of a file directory showing different types of files.

#### File Extensions

A **file extension** indicates the type of file.

-   **Examples**:
    -   `.txt`: Plain text file.
    -   `.jpg`: JPEG image file.
    -   `.exe`: Executable file that runs a program.
-   **Image Suggestion**: An infographic illustrating common file extensions with icons.

### 4. `.exe` Files

#### Definition

An **`.exe` file** is a specific type of executable file used on Windows.

#### Function

When you double-click an `.exe` file, it loads the necessary instructions into **RAM** and begins running as a **process**.

-   **Example**:
    -   Opening `notepad.exe` launches the Notepad application, allowing you to write text.
-   **Image Suggestion**: A screenshot showing a right-click on an `.exe` file in a Windows Explorer window.

#### Security Note

-   Be cautious with `.exe` files from unknown sources, as they can contain malware or viruses.

### 5. Software Types

#### System Software

-   **System software** manages hardware and provides a platform for running application software.

-   **Examples**: Windows, macOS, Linux.
-   **Image Suggestion**: An image of different operating systems' logos.

#### Application Software

-   **Application software** is designed for specific tasks.

-   **Examples**:
    -   Word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word).
    -   Web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome).
-   **Image Suggestion**: A collage of various application icons.

### 6. Programs vs. Processes

#### Program

A **program** is a collection of instructions stored on disk (e.g., in an `.exe` file).

-   **Example**: Microsoft Word is a program that you can open and run.

#### Process

A **process** is what happens when a program is actively running in memory.

-   **Example**: When you open Microsoft Word, the OS creates a process for it, allowing you to edit documents.
-   **Image Suggestion**: A diagram illustrating the difference between a program (on disk) and a process (in memory).
