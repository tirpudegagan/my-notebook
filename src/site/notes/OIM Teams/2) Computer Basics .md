### **Phase 1: Computer Basics**

#### **Understanding a Computer**

-   **What is a Computer?**
    -   **Definition**: A computer is an electronic machine that receives, processes, and stores data. You can think of it as a powerful tool that helps with all sorts of tasks by following instructions.
    -   **Purpose**: Computers do things quickly and accurately, from simple calculations to complex problem-solving. This is why they’re so useful in nearly every field today, from science to entertainment.
-   **Basic Components of a Computer**:

    -   **Hardware**:
        -   Hardware refers to all the physical parts of the computer that you can touch. This includes:
            -   **Monitor**: The screen that displays what you’re doing.
            -   **Keyboard and Mouse**: Tools to input data and interact with the computer.
            -   **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Often called the "brain" of the computer, the CPU processes the instructions given by programs.
            -   **Memory**: The space where data is temporarily or permanently stored so that it can be used later.
        -   Every part of the hardware has a specific job that helps the computer run smoothly.
    -   **Software**:
        -   Software is what gives instructions to the hardware, telling it what to do. Without software, a computer would just sit there without any way to interact with it.
        -   There are different types of software, such as:
            -   **System Software** (like Windows or macOS), which manages the hardware and lets other programs run.
            -   **Application Software** (like games or word processors), which are programs for specific tasks.
        -   Think of software as the director, guiding the hardware to perform tasks correctly.

#### **Fundamental Computer Concepts**

-   **Binary (0s and 1s)**:

    -   **Definition**: Binary is the language that all computers use to communicate and store data. It consists of only two symbols: 0 and 1. This is because, at the most basic level, computers work with electronic signals, which can be either "on" (1) or "off" (0).
    -   **Why Binary?** Computers work with electricity, which can be turned on and off quickly. Using only two states, on and off, is reliable and simple for computers to process.
    -   **How Binary Works**: Imagine you have a series of switches where each switch can be either on or off. Each combination of on and off represents a unique piece of information. When we see 0101, for example, the computer understands it as a small piece of data that could mean a letter, a number, or even part of an image, depending on how it's used.

-   **Processor (CPU)**:

    -   **Definition**: The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the part of the computer that executes instructions. It’s like the brain of the computer, handling millions of calculations per second to run programs.
    -   **Role**: The CPU reads instructions from software, decodes them into actions, and carries out those actions quickly. For example, when you open a program, the CPU processes the instructions needed to display the program on your screen.
    -   **Cores and Speed**: Modern CPUs have multiple cores, or mini-brains, that allow them to handle many tasks at once, making computers faster and more efficient.

-   **Memory**:

    -   Memory is where the computer stores data temporarily or permanently.

        -   **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:

            -   RAM is the computer's short-term memory. It stores data temporarily, allowing the computer to access it quickly while it’s needed.
            -   For example, when you’re editing a document, the data is stored in RAM so you can make changes quickly. But once you turn off the computer, RAM is cleared, and anything not saved is lost.

        -   **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
            -   ROM is the computer's long-term memory, storing data that the computer needs to start up. This memory stays the same and can’t be changed easily.
            -   When you turn on your computer, the instructions in ROM tell it how to boot up and start the operating system.

-   **Storage Basics**:

    -   **Files**:

        -   A file is a collection of data stored in a way that makes it easy to access. Files can be anything from a document to a photo, song, or video.
        -   Just like physical files in a filing cabinet, digital files keep information organized for later use.

    -   **File Extensions**:
        -   File extensions are a way of labeling files so the computer knows how to open them. For example, a `.txt` extension tells the computer it’s a text file, and a `.jpg` extension tells the computer it’s an image.
        -   This helps the computer and user know what kind of content is in a file and what program to use to open it.

#### **Software Types**

-   **System Software**:

    -   This is software that helps the computer run and manages its resources.
    -   The most common type of system software is the **Operating System (OS)**. The OS acts as a bridge between the computer hardware and the programs you use. It helps manage files, run applications, and handle the hardware.
    -   Examples include **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**. The OS is always running in the background, making sure everything works smoothly.

-   **Application Software**:
    -   Application software includes all the programs designed to help users complete tasks. Think of these as the tools in your computer’s toolbox.
    -   Examples include:
        -   **Word Processors**: Like Microsoft Word, for typing documents.
        -   **Browsers**: Like Google Chrome or Firefox, for surfing the internet.
        -   **Games**: Any program meant for entertainment is also application software.
    -   Application software relies on system software to work, as it needs the OS to access computer resources like memory and storage.

#### **Programs vs. Processes**

-   **Program**:

    -   A program is a set of instructions saved on your computer’s storage. It’s like a recipe that’s written down, waiting for someone to follow it. Programs can be inactive or "at rest" on the computer’s hard drive, and they won’t do anything until you open them.
    -   Examples include games you’ve installed or a photo-editing app. They are programs when they are stored on your computer.

-   **Process**:
    -   A process is what a program becomes when it’s actively running in the computer’s memory (RAM). When you open a program, it turns into a process and starts using the CPU and RAM.
    -   For example, when you open your web browser, it becomes an active process, which means it’s taking up some of the CPU’s attention and using part of the RAM. Once you close it, the process ends, freeing up resources for other tasks.
