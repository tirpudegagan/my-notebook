## **[[OIM Teams/4) OIM Fundamentals\|Phase 3: OIM Fundamentals]]**

Once you have a good grasp of Java, you can move on to learning Oracle Identity Manager basics.

### **3.1 What is Oracle Identity Manager (OIM)?**

-   OIM is a comprehensive identity management solution from Oracle that automates the provisioning and de-provisioning of user accounts across systems and applications.

### **3.2 Core Concepts in OIM**

1. **Provisioning and De-provisioning**:

    - **Provisioning**: Assigning user access and accounts to resources like databases or applications.
    - **De-provisioning**: Removing access when it's no longer needed.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

    - **Roles**: Groups that define access privileges for users.
    - **Entitlements**: Specific permissions assigned to a role.

3. **User Lifecycle Management**:

    - Managing user accounts from creation, modification, and deactivation.

4. **Connectors**:

    - OIM uses connectors to communicate with external systems (e.g., Active Directory, databases).
    - **Pre-built connectors**: OIM comes with ready connectors for common systems like LDAP, Salesforce, etc.
    - **Custom connectors**: Developers can create connectors for non-standard systems.

5. **Reconciliation**:
    - Synchronizing data between OIM and external systems.
    - **Trusted Reconciliation**: Data flows from the trusted system (e.g., HR system) to OIM.
    - **Target Reconciliation**: Data flows from OIM to the target system.

### **3.3 OIM Architecture**

1. **OIM Server**: The central server that manages identity management tasks.
2. **Database**: Stores user data, configurations, and audit logs.
3. **WebLogic Server**: Application server used to run OIM.
4. **OIM Design Console**: A client application used by developers to configure and manage OIM workflows, rules, and forms.

    - **User Management**: Creating, updating, and managing user data through API.
    - **Provisioning Management**: Automating provisioning and de-provisioning tasks using API calls.
    - **Role Management**: Managing roles and entitlements using the API.

2. **Event Handlers**:

    - Java classes that listen to events (e.g., user creation, modification) and perform actions based on these events.
    - **Types of Event Handlers**: Pre-process, post-process, and conditional event handlers.
    - **Use cases**: Automatically adding entitlements when a user is created.

3. **Custom Adapters**:

    - Code that automates certain actions in OIM, such as pre-populating fields or assigning tasks.

4. **UI Customization**:
    - Customizing the OIM web interface using the Oracle Identity Self Service Console.
    - Adding custom fields, modifying forms, and changing approval workflows.

### **4.2 Developing Custom Connectors**

1. **Introduction to OIM Connectors**:

    - Custom connectors allow OIM to communicate with external systems that don’t have out-of-the-box support.

2. **Creating Custom Connectors**:
    - Develop Java-based connectors for integrating with non-standard systems.
    - Use the **Connector Framework** for building, testing, and deploying these connectors.

### **4.3 SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) Integrations**

-   Integrating OIM with Oracle SOA Suite for advanced business process automation.
-   **BPEL (Business Process Execution Language)** workflows for handling complex multi-step processes in identity management.

### **4.4 Debugging and Troubleshooting in OIM**

-   **Log Files**: Understanding the key log files for troubleshooting (WebLogic logs, OIM logs).
